Here‚Äôs a cleaner, final version of your sub-README that improves clarity, consistency, and tone while keeping the structure and content intact:

# ‚¨áÔ∏è DDRO Dataset & Model Download Scripts

This folder contains scripts to download all datasets and pretrained models required for training and evaluating **Direct Document Relevance Optimization (DDRO)**.

---

## üìÅ Contents

```bash
download/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ download_msmarco_datasets.sh     # Download MS MARCO documents, qrels, and queries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ download_nq_datasets.sh          # Download Natural Questions (NQ) documents and qrels
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ download_t5_model.py             # Download the T5-base model and tokenizer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                        # You're here!
```

## üì¶ Dataset Download Instructions

### MS MARCO

Downloads passage-level documents, queries, and qrels:

```bash
bash download_msmarco_datasets.sh
```

---

### Natural Questions (NQ)

Downloads preprocessed NQ documents and relevance annotations:

```bash
bash download_nq_datasets.sh
```

---

## üß† Pretrained T5 Model

Downloads the `t5-base` model and tokenizer from Hugging Face:

```bash
python download_t5_model.py
```

---

## üìÇ Expected Directory Structure

After running the scripts, your file structure should look like:

```bash
resources/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ datasets/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ msmarco-data/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nq-data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transformer_models/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ t5-base/
```

> ‚úÖ Ensure all paths match the expected structure for downstream scripts to work properly.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è (Optional) Google Cloud SDK for `gs://` Downloads

Some MS MARCO files are hosted on Google Cloud Storage. To access them:

### Install Google Cloud SDK (Linux example)

```bash
curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-439.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xf google-cloud-sdk-439.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```

Then initialize:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
gcloud init
```

### Verify installation:

```bash
gcloud version
gsutil version
```
